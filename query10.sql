/**
10. You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops 
to fill the `stop_desc` field in a GTFS feed. Using any of the data sets above, 
PostGIS functions (e.g., `ST_Distance`, `ST_Azimuth`, etc.), and PostgreSQL string functions, 
build a description (alias as `stop_desc`) for each stop. Feel free to supplement with other 
datasets (must provide link to data used so it's reproducible), and other methods of describing 
the relationships. PostgreSQL's `CASE` statements may be helpful for some operations.

  **Structure:**
  ```sql
  (
      stop_id integer,
      stop_name text,
      stop_desc text,
      stop_lon double precision,
      stop_lat double precision
  )
  ```

  As an example, your `stop_desc` for a station stop may be something like "37 meters NE 
  of 1234 Market St" (that's only an example, feel free to be creative, silly, descriptive, etc.)
